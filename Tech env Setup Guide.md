## üß≠ Project Overview

The **DevOps Environment Setup Project** is designed as the foundational step for all students entering the DEVOPS program. Its primary goal is to prepare a robust and fully functional local development environment that mirrors real-world DevOps workflows. By completing this project, students will:

- Gain hands-on experience installing essential development and infrastructure tools.
- Understand how to configure local environments to support virtualization and cloud-based development.
- Learn the importance of version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.
- Establish personal accounts with cloud service providers such as AWS, which will be used throughout the program for deploying and managing infrastructure.

This setup is crucial for all upcoming projects, as it ensures each student begins with a consistent and reliable technical foundation.
